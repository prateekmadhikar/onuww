GAMEPLAN:
    1) Define actions you want to do in terms of API calls
    2) Implement the socket API and structure it well
    3) uhh
    4) Wonder if gameplan is even good
    5) Am I even good?
    6) omg
    7) don't get distracted

Questions:
    - How does the server run multiple games at once?
        - Make the game creator be the game controller? Nah
        - Start a new thread for each room? Probs
        -
    - How do you structure this code? I have an idea as to how to organize the API calls... not much more
        - Where does the game controller live?
    - Should the game controller by a state machine of some sort? I think it might be easier that way.
